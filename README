Description: currently, pillage's only job is to pillage web applications for forms and log them to a csv file. 
what someone does with those forms is up to them. soon it will also log form fields as well. 
-------
Required: lua5.1
Debian prereq: socket, curl
Linux Mint: apt-get install lua5.1 liblua5.1-socket-dev liblua5.1-curl-dev
-------
Short to do:
form based authentication.
replace url.socket with regex
threads - lots of threads
better error handling and debugging
submit forms for multi-stage form disc?
do not add previously found forms
find and log form fields

Notes:
