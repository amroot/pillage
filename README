Short might do:
Form based Authentication.
Replace socket with regex
Update cookiejar
Better error handling and debugging
Submit forms for multi-stage form disc?
Do not add forms found previously
Find and log form fields 
Add the ability to supply a list of directories, pages, and/or URIs.

Pillage usage: 
	-u	 - required: valid URL to crawl. http(s)://userid:password@www.attackersite.com:port
	-r	 - optional: follow redirects (301 response).
	-t	 - optional: time in milliseconds to pause between requests
	-s	 - optional: do not stay within scope (this might crawl the world)
	-w	 - optional: write to file in csv format. ./save.csv
	-m	 - optional: max URLs to follow. default is never stop crawling until there are no more to crawl
	-a	 - optional: user agent (pillage-agent/1.0 by default)
	-c	 - optional: cookie storage (default cookiejar.txt)
	-v	 - optional: verbosity. -v[1-3]
	-h	 - optional: what you're seeing right now

Example: 
	./pillage.lua -u http://www.attackersite.com -r -s -a 'attacker-agent/1.0' -t 500 -m 100 -w ./attackersite-forms.csv -v1
